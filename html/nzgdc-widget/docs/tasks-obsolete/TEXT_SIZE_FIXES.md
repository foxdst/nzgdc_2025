# NZGDC Event Panel Text Size Fixes - Unified Architecture

## Issue Summary
The text sizes in the Main Event Panel (300x300) components were inconsistent with the reference design specifications within the unified architecture. The implemented sizes were significantly smaller than intended, affecting readability and visual hierarchy. This document reflects the fixes applied to the consolidated system where all event panels use unified-event-panel.css.

**ARCHITECTURE CONTEXT:** This fix was applied to the unified architecture where all event panels (Thursday, Morning, Afternoon) use the same UnifiedEventLoader, unified-event-panel.html template, and unified-event-panel.css styling system.

## Files Modified (Unified Architecture)

### 1. `css/unified-event-panel.css` - PRIMARY CHANGES
**Main Event Panel (300x300) Text Size Updates in Unified CSS:**
- **Category Text**: `14px` → `16px` (font-weight: `600` → `500`, line-height: `18px` → `22px`)
- **Title Text**: `16px` → `18px` (line-height: `22px` → `26px`)
- **Speaker Name**: `12px` → `18px` (added `font-style: italic`, line-height: `16px` → `23px`)
- **Speaker Position**: `11px` → `18px` (line-height: `14px` → `23px`)
- **CTA Text**: `12px` → `16px` (line-height: `16px` → `21px`)

**Responsive Updates (480px breakpoint):**
- Title, Speaker Name, Speaker Position: Maintained proportional scaling with `16px` minimum
- All changes applied to unified CSS ensure consistency across all widget types

**CRITICAL:** All text size fixes applied to the unified CSS system ensure consistent typography across Thursday, Morning, and Afternoon widgets without code duplication.

### 2. Widget-Specific Bundle Files - LAYOUT ONLY
**Bundle files contain NO event panel text styling after consolidation:**
- ✅ `css/thursday-schedule-bundle.css` - Layout and theme only
- ✅ `css/morning-schedule-bundle.css` - Layout and theme only  
- ✅ `css/afternoon-schedule-bundle.css` - Layout and theme only

**POST-CONSOLIDATION RULE:** Event panel styling, including text sizes, exists ONLY in unified-event-panel.css. Bundle files contain schedule layout and widget theming only.

## Reference Design Compliance (Unified Architecture)

### Before Fix (Inconsistent Sizes)
- Category: 14px, Title: 16px, Speaker Name: 12px, Speaker Position: 11px, CTA: 12px
- **Problem:** Text sizes varied between widget types due to scattered CSS definitions

### After Fix (Reference Compliant - All Widgets)
- Category: 16px, Title: 18px, Speaker Name: 18px (italic), Speaker Position: 18px, CTA: 16px
- **Solution:** Unified CSS ensures consistent text sizes across Thursday, Morning, and Afternoon widgets

### Big Event Panel (620x300) - Unified System
- **No changes required** - already matched reference design specifications
- Category: 16px, Title: 18px, Speaker Name: 14px, Speaker Position: 14px, Timeframe: 16px
- **Benefit:** Single source of truth for all Big Event Panel typography across all widget types

### Cross-Widget Consistency
- ✅ **Thursday Widget:** Uses unified text sizing for all panels
- ✅ **Morning Widget:** Uses unified text sizing for all panels  
- ✅ **Afternoon Widget:** Uses unified text sizing for all panels
- ✅ **Future Widgets:** Automatically inherit correct text sizing

## Key Improvements (Unified Architecture Benefits)

1. **Visual Hierarchy**: Proper text sizing creates clear information hierarchy across all widgets
2. **Readability**: Increased font sizes improve legibility on all devices and widget types
3. **Cross-Widget Consistency**: All widget types (Thursday, Morning, Afternoon) use identical sizing from unified CSS
4. **Maintenance Efficiency**: Text size changes require updates in only one file (unified-event-panel.css)
5. **Responsive Design**: Maintained proportional scaling across all breakpoints for all widgets
6. **Reference Alignment**: Text sizes match original design specifications across entire system
7. **Future-Proof**: New widgets automatically inherit correct text sizing
8. **Zero Duplication**: Single source of truth eliminates text size inconsistencies

## Testing Recommendations (Unified Architecture)

1. **Load Demo Interface:** Open `widget-demo.html` (unified testing interface)
2. **Test All Widget Types:** Verify Thursday, Morning, and Afternoon widgets all use consistent text sizing
3. **Cross-Widget Validation:** Switch between widgets to ensure no text size conflicts
4. **Responsive Testing:** Verify text sizes on desktop and mobile breakpoints for all widgets
5. **Unified System Testing:** Use `testUnifiedSystem()` to verify architecture integrity
6. **CSS Validation:** Use `testMainEventPanelCSS()` to verify unified CSS functioning
7. **Browser Testing:** Test across browsers to ensure unified CSS loads correctly
8. **Widget Switching:** Verify text remains consistent when switching between widget types

### Unified Architecture Test Commands
```javascript
// Test unified system integrity
testUnifiedSystem();

// Test main panel CSS across all widgets  
testMainEventPanelCSS();

// Enable detailed debugging
window.NZGDC_DEBUG = true;

// Verify UnifiedEventLoader availability
typeof UnifiedEventLoader !== 'undefined';
```

## Technical Notes (Unified Architecture)

- **CSS Consolidation**: All text sizing moved to unified-event-panel.css eliminates specificity conflicts
- **Single Source of Truth**: Font-weight, line-height, and sizing defined once for all widgets
- **Widget Context Support**: UnifiedEventLoader applies text sizing consistently across all widget contexts
- **Line-height Optimization**: Values optimized for better vertical rhythm across all widget types
- **Overflow Handling**: `overflow-wrap: break-word` applied consistently via unified CSS
- **Responsive Scaling**: Maintains readability at all screen sizes for all widgets
- **Performance Benefit**: Single CSS file reduces loading time and eliminates duplicate rules
- **Maintenance Benefit**: Text size updates require changes in only one location
- **Future-Proof**: New widgets automatically inherit correct typography
- **Category Integration Ready**: Text sizing system ready for Event Categories implementation

### Architecture Integration
- ✅ **UnifiedEventLoader**: Applies text styling consistently across all widgets
- ✅ **Unified Template**: Single HTML structure ensures consistent text element hierarchy  
- ✅ **Unified CSS**: Single CSS file eliminates text sizing conflicts and duplication
- ✅ **Widget Context**: Text styling adapts appropriately to Thursday/Morning/Afternoon contexts
