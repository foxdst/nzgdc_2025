# Focused Events Reordering Feature - Implementation Documentation

**Feature Version:** v1.1 - Enhanced with Animation Fixes & Two-Level Reordering  
**Status:** ‚úÖ **COMPLETE & PRODUCTION READY**  
**Implementation Date:** December 2024  
**Dependencies:** Event Categories Dropdown Filter System (v1.1)

## üéØ Feature Overview

The Focused Events Reordering feature enhances the existing Event Categories Dropdown Filter system by implementing a sophisticated two-level reordering system that prioritizes both relevant time slots and matching events within those time slots.

**Key Innovation:** When a category filter is applied, the system performs two levels of intelligent reordering:
1. **Time Slot Level:** Entire time slots containing filtered events move to the top of the schedule
2. **Within-Row Level:** Within each time slot, matching events move to the front of their respective rows

This creates an optimal visual hierarchy where users never have to scroll past irrelevant content to find filtered events.

## ‚ú® Feature Capabilities

### Core Functionality
- **Two-Level Smart Reordering:** 
  - Time slots with filtered events move to top of schedule
  - Within each time slot, matching events move to front of their rows
- **Flexbox-Based Animation:** Smooth CSS order transitions replace jarring DOM manipulation
- **Content Preservation:** Event panels maintain their loaded content during both levels of repositioning
- **Visual Hierarchy Enhancement:** Time slots with filtered events get blue accent backgrounds and higher z-index
- **Selective Dimming:** Time slots without filtered events become 70% opacity for better focus
- **Perfect Reset:** Both time slot and event order restore to exact original positions
- **Cross-Widget Support:** Works identically across Morning and Afternoon schedules

### Visual Enhancements
- **Time Slot Highlighting:** Relevant time slots get blue accent backgrounds with gradient borders
- **Event Focus Styling:** Filtered events get subtle gradient borders and enhanced z-index
- **Pulse Animation:** 2-second intro animation draws attention to reordered events
- **Selective Dimming:** Non-relevant time slots fade to 70% opacity for better contrast
- **Hardware-Accelerated Transitions:** CSS flexbox order transitions for smooth, performant animations

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Implementation

### Architecture Integration

**Builds Upon:** Existing dropdown filter system in `category-filter-overlay.css`  
**Extends:** Morning and Afternoon Schedule Generators  
**Maintains:** Full backward compatibility with existing filter functionality

### Implementation Files

#### Enhanced Schedule Generators
- **`js/morning-schedule-generator.js`** - Added reordering methods to MorningScheduleGenerator
- **`js/afternoon-schedule-generator.js`** - Added reordering methods to AfternoonScheduleGenerator

#### Enhanced CSS Styling
- **`css/category-filter-overlay.css`** - Added animation and visual enhancement styles

#### Testing Environment
- **`.widget-tests/focused-events-reordering-test.html`** - Comprehensive test demo

### Core Methods Added

#### `reorderTimeSlotsByRelevance()`
**Purpose:** Move time slots containing filtered events to the top of the schedule  
**Location:** Both schedule generators  
**Process:**
1. Analyzes all time slots for presence of filtered events
2. Separates relevant (containing filtered events) from non-relevant time slots
3. Reorders schedule: relevant time slots first, then non-relevant time slots
4. Applies visual highlighting classes and smooth transitions

#### `reorderFocusedEventsToTop()`
**Purpose:** Reorganize events within rows using CSS flexbox order  
**Location:** Both schedule generators  
**Process:**
1. Identifies all event rows in relevant time slots
2. Separates focused (filtered-in) from non-focused events within each row
3. Uses CSS flexbox order property for smooth transitions instead of DOM manipulation
4. Applies visual enhancements and maintains content integrity

#### `restoreOriginalTimeSlotOrder()`
**Purpose:** Return time slots to their original schedule positions  
**Location:** Both schedule generators  
**Process:**
1. Regenerates entire schedule container from preserved original data
2. Maintains loaded event panel content during restoration
3. Ensures smooth transition back to original time slot order

#### `restoreOriginalEventOrder()`
**Purpose:** Clear CSS flexbox order properties to restore original event positions  
**Location:** Both schedule generators  
**Process:**
1. Removes all CSS order, transition, and display properties
2. Clears time slot highlighting classes
3. Returns rows to original CSS display mode

### Integration Points

#### Filter Application Hook
```javascript
// In applyEventFiltering() method - after CSS class application
this.debug("Event filtering completed");

// NEW: Apply two-level focused event reordering
this.reorderTimeSlotsByRelevance();
this.reorderFocusedEventsToTop();
```

#### Filter Reset Hook
```javascript
// In clearEventFiltering() method - after CSS class removal
this.debug("All event filtering cleared");

// NEW: Restore original time slot and event order
this.restoreOriginalTimeSlotOrder();
this.restoreOriginalEventOrder();
```

## üé® CSS Enhancements

### Flexbox-Based Animation System
```css
/* Enable flexbox for event rows to support CSS order-based reordering */
.nzgdc-morning-schedule-widget .nzgdc-morning-event-row,
.nzgdc-afternoon-schedule-widget .nzgdc-afternoon-event-row {
    display: flex;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
    transition: all 0.4s ease-in-out;
}

/* Smooth transition for event containers when reordering */
.nzgdc-morning-schedule-widget .nzgdc-morning-event,
.nzgdc-morning-schedule-widget .nzgdc-morning-event-main {
    transition:
        order 0.3s cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1),
        transform 0.3s cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1),
        opacity 0.3s ease-in-out;
}

/* Time slot level reordering transitions */
.nzgdc-morning-schedule-widget .nzgdc-morning-time-category {
    transition:
        transform 0.4s ease-in-out,
        opacity 0.3s ease-in-out;
}
```

### Visual Enhancement System
```css
/* Time slot highlighting for sections with filtered events */
.nzgdc-morning-schedule-widget .nzgdc-morning-time-category.has-filtered-events::before {
    content: "";
    position: absolute;
    top: -2px; left: -2px; right: -2px; bottom: -2px;
    background: linear-gradient(45deg, rgba(0, 123, 255, 0.1), rgba(0, 123, 255, 0.05));
    border-radius: 4px;
    z-index: -1;
}

/* Enhanced focus styling for individual filtered events */
.nzgdc-morning-schedule-widget .nzgdc-morning-event-panel-container.filtered-in::after {
    content: "";
    position: absolute;
    top: -2px; left: -2px; right: -2px; bottom: -2px;
    background: linear-gradient(45deg, rgba(0, 123, 255, 0.3), rgba(0, 123, 255, 0.1));
    border-radius: 4px;
    z-index: -1;
    animation: focusedEventPulse 2s ease-in-out;
}

/* Dimming for time slots without filtered events */
.nzgdc-morning-schedule-widget .nzgdc-morning-time-category.no-filtered-events {
    opacity: 0.7;
    transition: opacity 0.4s ease-in-out;
}
```

### Pulse Animation
```css
@keyframes focusedEventPulse {
    0% { opacity: 0.8; transform: scale(1.02); }
    50% { opacity: 0.4; transform: scale(1.01); }
    100% { opacity: 0.3; transform: scale(1); }
}
```
