# Category Color Consistency and Widget Toggle Fixes
**Date:** December 2024  
**Type:** Bug Fix  
**Scope:** Event Category Styling, Widget Demo Toggle System, Event Panel Reordering Removal

---

## Overview

This changelog documents critical fixes for event category background color inconsistencies and widget toggle functionality in the NZGDC Schedule Widget system.

---

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Event Category Background Color Inconsistency

**Problem:**
- The "Serious & Educational Games" category displayed incorrect background colors in the Thursday schedule
- Dropdown items showed blue background (`#bae1ff`) instead of the correct orange (`#ffafaf`)
- Filter labels also used incorrect blue background instead of matching orange
- This created visual inconsistency across different schedule views

**Root Cause:**
- Thursday schedule CSS (`.nzgdc-schedule-widget`) had different color definitions than Morning/Afternoon schedules
- The category colors were not synchronized across all widget types

**Solution:**
- Updated Thursday schedule dropdown item colors to match Morning/Afternoon schedules:
  - Changed `background-color` from `#bae1ff` to `#ffafaf`
  - Changed hover `background-color` from `#aad7ff` to `#ff9f9f`
- Updated Thursday filter label colors to maintain consistency:
  - Changed filter label `background-color` from `#bae1ff` to `#ffafaf`

### 2. Widget Toggle Functionality Issue

**Problem:**
- When switching from Afternoon schedule to Thursday schedule in the widget demo, the Afternoon widget was not properly destroyed
- This caused multiple widgets to remain active simultaneously
- Container visibility was not properly managed for the afternoon container

### 3. Event Panel Reordering Still Present

**Problem:**
- The Morning and Afternoon schedule widgets still contained time slot reordering logic that should have been removed
- When filtering events, time slots with filtered events were being moved to the top of the schedule
- This caused visual disruption and inconsistent user experience across schedule types

**Root Cause:**
- The `reorderTimeSlotsByRelevance()` and `restoreOriginalTimeSlotOrder()` methods were not removed from the Morning and Afternoon schedule generators
- These methods were called during filtering operations, causing unwanted DOM manipulation

**Solution:**
- Completely removed `reorderTimeSlotsByRelevance()` method from both Morning and Afternoon schedule generators
- Removed `restoreOriginalTimeSlotOrder()` method from both schedule generators
- Eliminated all calls to these methods in the filtering pipeline
- Removed associated time slot highlighting classes (`has-filtered-events`, `no-filtered-events`)

**Root Cause:**
- The `showThursdayWidget()` function was missing cleanup code for the afternoon widget
- Only morning widget cleanup was implemented

**Solution:**
- Added afternoon widget destruction in `showThursdayWidget()` function:
  - Destroy `currentAfternoonWidget` if loaded
  - Reset `afternoonWidgetLoaded` flag
  - Hide and reset afternoon container content
- Ensures proper three-way toggle cycle: Thursday → Morning → Afternoon → Thursday

## Implementation Details

### Category Color Consistency
```css
/* BEFORE - Incorrect blue background for Thursday */
.nzgdc-schedule-widget
    .category-dropdown-item[data-category="SERIOUS_EDUCATIONAL"] {
    background-color: #bae1ff;  /* WRONG - Blue */
    color: #000000;
}

/* AFTER - Correct orange background matching other schedules */
.nzgdc-schedule-widget
    .category-dropdown-item[data-category="SERIOUS_EDUCATIONAL"] {
    background-color: #ffafaf;  /* CORRECT - Orange */
    color: #000000;
}
```

### Widget Toggle Fix
```javascript
// Added afternoon widget cleanup in showThursdayWidget()
if (currentAfternoonWidget && typeof currentAfternoonWidget.destroy === 'function') {
    try {
        currentAfternoonWidget.destroy();
    } catch (e) {}
    currentAfternoonWidget = null;
    afternoonWidgetLoaded = false;
}
```

### Event Panel Reordering Removal
```javascript
// REMOVED - No longer reordering time slots
// this.reorderTimeSlotsByRelevance();

// REMOVED - No longer restoring original order
// this.restoreOriginalTimeSlotOrder();

// Filtering now only applies CSS classes without DOM manipulation
this.debug("Event filtering completed");
```

## Testing

### Manual Testing Performed
1. **Category Color Consistency:**
   - Verified "Serious & Educational Games" category shows orange background in Thursday schedule dropdown
   - Confirmed filter label shows correct orange background when category is selected
   - Checked consistency across all schedule types (Thursday, Morning, Afternoon)

2. **Widget Toggle Functionality:**
   - Tested full toggle cycle: Thursday → Morning → Afternoon → Thursday
   - Verified only one widget is active at any time
   - Confirmed proper container visibility management
   - Tested widget destruction and memory cleanup

3. **Event Panel Reordering Removal:**
   - Verified no time slot reordering occurs during filtering in Morning schedule
   - Confirmed no time slot reordering occurs during filtering in Afternoon schedule
   - Tested that events remain in their original positions when filtered
   - Ensured consistent filtering behavior across all schedule types

### Browser Compatibility
- Chrome: ✅ Tested and working
- Firefox: ✅ Tested and working
- Safari: ✅ Tested and working
- Edge: ✅ Tested and working

## Impact Assessment

### Positive Impact
- **Visual Consistency:** All event categories now display consistent colors across schedule types
- **User Experience:** Improved widget switching without memory leaks or visual artifacts, and stable event positioning during filtering
- **Performance:** Proper widget cleanup prevents resource accumulation, and removal of DOM manipulation improves filtering performance
- **Consistency:** All schedule types now behave identically during filtering operations

### Risk Assessment
- **Risk Level:** Low
- **Backward Compatibility:** Full - no breaking changes to existing functionality
- **Production Ready:** Yes - changes are isolated and well-tested

---

## Future Considerations

1. **Centralized Color Management:**
   - Consider implementing CSS custom properties for category colors
   - Create a single source of truth for all category color definitions

2. **Widget Management Enhancement:**
   - Implement widget manager class for better lifecycle control
   - Add automatic cleanup detection for orphaned widgets

3. **Testing Automation:**
   - Add unit tests for widget toggle functionality
   - Implement visual regression tests for category color consistency
