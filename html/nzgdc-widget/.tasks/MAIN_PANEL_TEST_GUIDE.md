# Main Event Panel CSS Fix Testing Guide

## Overview
This guide helps you verify that the Main Event Panel CSS fix is working correctly for both Morning and Afternoon widgets.

## Issue Background
The Main Event Panel designs (300x300 square format) were missing/not displaying correctly in the Morning and Afternoon schedule widgets. This was caused by CSS specificity conflicts between the unified CSS and widget-scoped styles.

## Fix Applied
- Added comprehensive Main Event Panel CSS directly to `morning-schedule-bundle.css`
- Added comprehensive Main Event Panel CSS directly to `afternoon-schedule-bundle.css`
- Ensured proper widget-scoping to prevent conflicts

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Open the Demo Page
Open `widget-demo.html` in your browser.

### 2. Visual Testing

#### Test Morning Widget:
1. Click "Show Morning Widget" button
2. Wait for the widget to load completely
3. Look for 300x300 square event panels (should appear in rows of 5)
4. Verify panels show:
   - Red category header at top
   - Event title in middle section
   - Dark overlay with speaker details at bottom
   - "Click for More Event Details" call-to-action

#### Test Afternoon Widget:
1. Click "Show Afternoon Widget" button  
2. Wait for the widget to load completely
3. Look for 300x300 square event panels (should appear in rows of 5)
4. Verify same panel structure as morning widget

### 3. Console Testing

#### Automatic CSS Verification:
1. Open browser Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Run: `testMainEventPanelCSS()`
4. Check results - should show:
   ```
   üéâ SUCCESS: Main Event Panel CSS fix is working correctly!
   ‚úÖ Both Morning and Afternoon widgets have proper main panel styles
   ‚úÖ CSS specificity conflicts have been resolved
   ```

#### Manual CSS Inspection:
1. Right-click on a main event panel (300x300 square)
2. Select "Inspect Element"
3. Check computed styles for `.nzgdc-event-panel-main`
4. Should show:
   - `width: 300px`
   - `height: 300px` 
   - `display: flex`
   - `flex-direction: column`

### 4. Expected Results

#### ‚úÖ Success Indicators:
- Main event panels display as 300x300 squares
- Panels show proper content structure (category, title, speakers)
- No empty or broken panel containers
- Console test returns success status
- CSS computed styles show correct dimensions

#### ‚ùå Failure Indicators:
- Empty white/gray boxes where panels should be
- Panels showing only "Loading..." text
- Console errors about missing CSS classes
- Console test returns warning/error status
- CSS computed styles show incorrect dimensions

### 5. Common Issues & Solutions

#### Issue: Panels Still Not Displaying
**Solution:** Clear browser cache and reload page

#### Issue: Console Test Shows CSS Rules = 0
**Solution:** Check that CSS bundle files loaded correctly:
- `css/morning-schedule-bundle.css`
- `css/afternoon-schedule-bundle.css`

#### Issue: Mixed Results (One Widget Works, Other Doesn't)
**Solution:** Verify both CSS bundle files were updated with main panel styles
