## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS

### 1. Production Deployment Steps
```bash
# 1. Deploy new unified files
cp nzgdc-friday-saturday-schedule-widget-modular.js /production/
cp css/friday-saturday-schedule-bundle.css /production/css/
cp js/friday-saturday-widget-core.js /production/js/

# 2. Update widget-demo.html
cp .widget-tests/widget-demo.html /production/.widget-tests/

# 3. Clear CDN cache if applicable
curl -X PURGE "https://cdn.domain.com/js/nzgdc-friday-saturday-*"
curl -X PURGE "https://cdn.domain.com/css/friday-saturday-*"

# 4. Test deployment
curl -I "https://domain.com/nzgdc-friday-saturday-schedule-widget-modular.js"
# Expected: HTTP 200 OK
```

### 2. Post-Deployment Verification
- ✅ Load widget-demo.html and verify toggle functionality
- ✅ Test Morning Events button switches to morning view
- ✅ Test Afternoon Events button switches to afternoon view
- ✅ Verify category filters work in both views
- ✅ Confirm Thursday schedule integration unchanged
- ✅ Check browser console for any JavaScript errors (should be none)

### 3. Monitoring Requirements
**Critical Metrics to Monitor:**
- Widget load success rate (should remain 100%)
- JavaScript error rates (should remain zero)
- User interaction patterns (should be unchanged)
- Page load times (should be within baseline ±20%)

## 🚨 ROLLBACK PROCEDURES

### Emergency Rollback (if needed)
**ONLY execute if critical issues are detected post-deployment**

#### Quick Rollback Commands:
```bash
# 1. Restore original files from deprecated folder
cp deprecated/nzgdc-morning-schedule-widget-modular.js ./
cp deprecated/nzgdc-afternoon-schedule-widget-modular.js ./
cp deprecated/morning-schedule-bundle.css css/
cp deprecated/afternoon-schedule-bundle.css css/
cp deprecated/morning-widget-core.js js/
cp deprecated/afternoon-widget-core.js js/

# 2. Restore original widget-demo.html (if backup exists)
cp widget-demo-backup.html .widget-tests/widget-demo.html

# 3. Remove new unified files
rm nzgdc-friday-saturday-schedule-widget-modular.js
rm css/friday-saturday-schedule-bundle.css  
rm js/friday-saturday-widget-core.js

# 4. Clear CDN cache
curl -X PURGE "https://cdn.domain.com/js/*"
curl -X PURGE "https://cdn.domain.com/css/*"
```

#### Rollback Validation:
- ✅ Verify original morning widget works: `window.NZGDCMorningWidget.create()`
- ✅ Verify original afternoon widget works: `window.NZGDCAfternoonWidget.create()`
- ✅ Test 3-way toggle: Thursday → Morning → Afternoon → Thursday
- ✅ Confirm all original functionality restored

### Rollback Decision Criteria
**Execute rollback immediately if ANY of these occur:**
- JavaScript errors in browser console
- Widget creation failures
- Visual differences from original implementation
- Performance regression >20%
- User reports of broken functionality
- Category filter malfunction
- Mobile layout issues
