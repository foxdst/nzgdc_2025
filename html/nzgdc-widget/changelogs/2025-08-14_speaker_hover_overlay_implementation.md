# Speaker Details Hover Overlay Implementation Changelog
**Date**: 2025-08-14  
**Task**: Implement speaker details hover overlay functionality for both Big and Main event panels

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `js/unified-event-loader.js`

#### Added new method: `setupSpeakerDetailsHover()`
- **Line Range**: Lines 544-565
- **Purpose**: Main entry point for hover functionality, detects panel type and routes to appropriate handler
- **Dependencies**: Calls `setupBigPanelHover()` or `setupMainPanelHover()` based on panel type detection

#### Added new method: `setupBigPanelHover()`
- **Line Range**: Lines 567-596
- **Purpose**: Handles hover behavior for Big Event Panels (620x300)
- **Target Elements**: `.nzgdc-session-thumbnail-big` and `.nzgdc-event-detail-overlay-big`
- **Behavior**: Sets overlay opacity to 0 by default, shows on hover (opacity 1), hides on exit (opacity 0)
- **Transition**: 300ms ease-in-out opacity transition

#### Added new method: `setupMainPanelHover()`
- **Line Range**: Lines 598-625
- **Purpose**: Handles hover behavior for Main Event Panels (300x300)
- **Target Elements**: `.nzgdc-session-thumbnail-main` and `.nzgdc-event-panel-overlay-main`
- **Behavior**: Sets overlay opacity to 0 by default, shows on hover (opacity 1), hides on exit (opacity 0)
- **Transition**: 300ms ease-in-out opacity transition

#### Modified existing method: `updateBigEventContent()`
- **Change**: Added call to `this.setupSpeakerDetailsHover(eventPanel, eventData)` at line 540
- **Purpose**: Integrate hover functionality for Big panels after content is populated

#### Modified existing method: `createMainEventPanel()`
- **Change**: Added setTimeout call to `this.setupSpeakerDetailsHover(mainPanel, eventData)` at lines 370-373
- **Purpose**: Integrate hover functionality for Main panels after panel creation
- **Timing**: 0ms timeout to allow DOM to update before setting up hover events

## Implementation Details

### Panel Type Detection
- Big panels detected by presence of `.nzgdc-event-panel-big-thumbnail`
- Main panels detected by presence of `.nzgdc-event-panel-thumbnail-main`
- Unknown panel types are gracefully skipped with debug logging

### Default Overlay State
- All overlays set to `opacity: 0` by default (hidden)
- Clean thumbnail images visible by default
- Overlays appear on hover to provide interaction cues

### Hover Event Handlers
- `mouseenter`: Sets overlay opacity to 1
- `mouseleave`: Sets overlay opacity to 0
- Debug logging for all hover state changes

### CSS Transitions
- Applied via JavaScript: `transition: opacity 0.3s ease-in-out`
- Consistent 300ms timing for both panel types

## Files Modified
1. `js/unified-event-loader.js` - Added 3 new methods, modified 2 existing methods

## Files Created
- None

## Known Issues
- Implementation untested
- May conflict with existing overlay functionality
- Event listener cleanup not implemented for dynamic widget destruction
- Touch device behavior not specifically addressed
- Overlays now hidden by default which changes the current visual behavior
- Click functionality may be affected when overlays are hidden by default

## Critical Bug Fixes Applied
- **EMERGENCY FIX**: Changed `eventPanel` parameter to `clone` in line 540 call to match actual `updateBigEventContent()` method signature
- **Root Cause**: Used incorrect parameter name causing `ReferenceError: eventPanel is not defined`
- **Impact**: Widget loading completely broken until fixed

- **HOVER TARGET FIX**: Changed hover targets from background thumbnail elements to container elements
- **Big Panel**: Changed from `.nzgdc-session-thumbnail-big` to `.nzgdc-event-panel-big-thumbnail`
- **Main Panel**: Changed from `.nzgdc-session-thumbnail-main` to `.nzgdc-event-panel-thumbnail-main`
- **Root Cause**: Background thumbnail elements have `z-index: -1` and cannot receive hover events
- **Impact**: Hover functionality was not working despite overlays being hidden correctly

- **FLASH OF CONTENT FIX**: Moved initial opacity and transition styles from JavaScript to CSS
- **CSS Changes**: Added `opacity: 0` and `transition: opacity 0.3s ease-in-out` to overlay classes
- **JavaScript Changes**: Removed redundant style setting code since CSS now handles initial state
- **Root Cause**: JavaScript was setting opacity after DOM creation, causing brief flash of content
- **Impact**: Eliminates annoying flash of speaker details on Main Event Panel load

- **TRANSITION SPEED ADJUSTMENT**: Reduced fade transition duration from 300ms to 100ms
- **CSS Changes**: Changed `transition: opacity 0.3s ease-in-out` to `transition: opacity 0.1s ease-in-out`
- **Applied To**: Both `.nzgdc-event-detail-overlay-big` and `.nzgdc-event-panel-overlay-main`
- **Impact**: Fast, responsive hover transitions with good balance between speed and smoothness

- **ACCESSIBILITY CLICK IMPROVEMENT**: Made entire overlay areas clickable for better accessibility
- **JavaScript Changes**: Added click event listeners to both overlay types that delegate to existing CTA click handlers
- **CSS Changes**: Added `cursor: pointer` to both overlay classes
- **Big Panel**: Entire `.nzgdc-event-detail-overlay-big` now clickable, triggers `.nzgdc-call-to-action-big` click
- **Main Panel**: Entire `.nzgdc-event-panel-overlay-main` now clickable, triggers `.nzgdc-call-to-action-main` click
- **Impact**: Larger click target area improves usability and accessibility compliance

- **CSS COMPATIBILITY FIX**: Added standard `line-clamp` property alongside `-webkit-line-clamp`
- **CSS Changes**: Added `line-clamp: 3;` to `.nzgdc-title-text-main` class
- **Root Cause**: CSS linter warning about missing standard property for future compatibility
- **Impact**: Ensures text truncation works consistently across all browsers and future CSS standards

## Rollback Instructions
To disable this feature:
1. Comment out `this.setupSpeakerDetailsHover(clone, eventData)` at line 540 in `updateBigEventContent()`
2. Comment out the setTimeout call at lines 370-373 in `createMainEventPanel()`
3. Remove the three new methods: `setupSpeakerDetailsHover()`, `setupBigPanelHover()`, `setupMainPanelHover()`
4. Remove `cursor: pointer` from overlay CSS classes in `unified-event-panel.css`
