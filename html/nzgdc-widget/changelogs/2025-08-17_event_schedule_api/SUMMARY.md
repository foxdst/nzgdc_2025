# NZGDC Widget Issues - Resolution Summary

## Problems Fixed

### 1. Day Filtering Issue
**Problem**: All events were showing in the Thursday widget, while Friday/Saturday widgets were empty.

**Root Cause**: Widgets tried to create JavaScript `Date` objects from incomplete time strings:
- API provides: `startTime: "09:00"` (just hours:minutes)
- Widget tried: `new Date("09:00")` → **Invalid Date**
- Result: Date-based filtering failed, events defaulted to Thursday widget

**Fix**: Created proper datetime handling by combining schedule date with session time:
```javascript
const fullDateTime = `${schedule.date}T${event.startTime}:00`; 
// "2025-09-25T09:00:00"
const dateObj = new Date(fullDateTime); // Valid Date object
```

### 2. Category Mapping Issue  
**Problem**: Events were displaying incorrect categories (all showing as "PROGRAMMER") with console errors like "Invalid category key: CAREER, falling back to default".

**Root Cause**: The system was using "audience categories" (Student, Mid Career, etc.) for visual categorization instead of "streams" (Game Design, Programming, Art).

**Fix**: Updated data transformer to use streams for visual categorization:
```javascript
// Before: Used audience level for styling
const categoryKey = primaryCategory.name; // "MID_CAREER"

// After: Use subject area for styling  
const categoryKey = stream ? mapStreamToKey(stream.title) : null; // "GAME_DESIGN"
```

### 3. Speaker Name Population Issue
**Problem**: Speaker names were not displaying in event panels or expanded details, showing placeholder text like "Speaker Name" or "Speaker TBA" instead.

**Root Cause**: The API uses `displayName` field for speaker names, but widgets were looking for `name` field:
- API provides: `"displayName": "Aimee Cairns"`
- Widget tried: `speaker.name` → **undefined**
- Result: Speaker names showed placeholder text, position+company info incomplete

**Fix**: Enhanced data transformation and added fallback logic:
```javascript
// Data transformer: Add name field for compatibility
name: speaker.displayName, // Add name field for widget compatibility
position: `${speaker.position} at ${speaker.company}`, // Combined for display

// Widget rendering: Fallback logic
const speakerName = speaker.name || speaker.displayName || "Speaker TBA";
```

## Files Changed
- `js/widget-core.js` - Fixed Thursday widget day filtering
- `js/friday-saturday-widget-core.js` - Fixed Friday/Saturday widget day filtering  
- `js/data-transformer.js` - Fixed category mapping and enhanced speaker data transformation
- `js/unified-event-loader.js` - Added speaker name fallback logic and safety checks
