# Speaker Name Population Fix - NZGDC Schedule Widget

## Issue Summary

The NZGDC Schedule Widget system was not properly displaying speaker names in any of the event panel variations (big panels, main panels) or in the expanded event details overlay. All speaker name elements were showing placeholder text like "Speaker Name", "Speaker TBA", or remaining empty.

## Root Cause Analysis

### API Data Structure vs Widget Expectations

The root cause was a mismatch between the API data structure and what the widget code expected:

**API Structure** (from n8n-entegyapi.json):
```json
{
  "speakers": [
    {
      "displayName": "Aimee Cairns",
      "position": "Concept Artist, UI/UX Design", 
      "company": "Ninjakiwi"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Widget Expectation**:
- Widgets were looking for `speaker.name` property
- API provided `speaker.displayName` property
- Result: `speaker.name` was `undefined`, causing fallback to placeholder text

### Missing Data Transformation

The data transformer was preserving the original API field names but not creating the compatibility fields that the widgets expected:

```javascript
// BROKEN - Original transformation
DataTransformer.prototype._standardizeSpeaker = function (speaker) {
  return {
    id: speaker.id,
    displayName: speaker.displayName,  // ✓ Preserved
    position: speaker.position,        // ✓ Preserved  
    company: speaker.company,          // ✓ Preserved
    // Missing: name field for widget compatibility ❌
  };
};
```

### Incomplete Position Display

The widgets expected a single `position` field containing both job title and company, but the API separated these into `position` and `company` fields. This resulted in incomplete speaker information being displayed.

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Enhanced Data Transformation

Updated `_standardizeSpeaker()` method in `js/data-transformer.js`:

```javascript
DataTransformer.prototype._standardizeSpeaker = function (speaker) {
  // Create combined position + company field for display
  let combinedPosition = speaker.position || "";
  if (speaker.company && speaker.position) {
    combinedPosition = `${speaker.position} at ${speaker.company}`;
  } else if (speaker.company && !speaker.position) {
    combinedPosition = speaker.company;
  }

  return {
    id: speaker.id,
    name: speaker.displayName, // ✅ Add name field for widget compatibility
    displayName: speaker.displayName,
    position: combinedPosition, // ✅ Combined position + company for display
    originalPosition: speaker.position, // Preserve original position
    company: speaker.company,
    // ... other fields
  };
};
```

### 2. Enhanced Safety Checks in Unified Event Loader

Added fallback logic to handle both `name` and `displayName` fields:

```javascript
// Big Panel Speaker Rendering
const speakerName = speaker.name || speaker.displayName || "Speaker TBA";
nameEl.textContent = speakerName;

// Main Panel Speaker Rendering  
<div class="nzgdc-speaker-name-main">Presented by ${
  eventData.speakers?.[0]?.name || 
  eventData.speakers?.[0]?.displayName || 
  "Speaker Name"
}</div>
```

### 3. Enhanced Safety Checks in Expanded Event Details

Updated speaker name handling to use fallback logic:

```javascript
// Speaker List Population
speakerItem.textContent = speaker.name || speaker.displayName || "Speaker TBA";

// Speaker Bio Card Creation
nameDiv.textContent = speaker.name || speaker.displayName || "Speaker Name";
positionDiv.textContent = speaker.position || "Position";
descriptionDiv.textContent = speaker.bio || "Bio information not available";
```

### 4. Improved Speaker Data Validation

Enhanced speaker array processing with validation:

```javascript
// Validate speaker data before processing
let speakers = [];
if (eventData.speakers && Array.isArray(eventData.speakers) && eventData.speakers.length > 0) {
  speakers = eventData.speakers.filter(speaker => speaker && typeof speaker === 'object');
}

// Fallback if no valid speakers
if (speakers.length === 0) {
  speakers = [{ name: "TBA", position: "Speaker details coming soon" }];
}
```

## Expected Results

### Before Fix
```
Big Panel:
- Speaker Name: [empty] ❌
- Speaker Position: "Concept Artist, UI/UX Design" ⚠️ (missing company)

Main Panel:  
- "Presented by Speaker Name" ❌
- "Position + Company" ❌

Expanded Details:
- Speaker Name: [empty] ❌  
- Position: "Concept Artist, UI/UX Design" ⚠️ (missing company)
```

### After Fix
```
Big Panel:
- Speaker Name: "Aimee Cairns" ✅
- Speaker Position: "Concept Artist, UI/UX Design at Ninjakiwi" ✅

Main Panel:
- "Presented by Aimee Cairns" ✅  
- "Concept Artist, UI/UX Design at Ninjakiwi" ✅

Expanded Details:
- Speaker Name: "Aimee Cairns" ✅
- Position: "Concept Artist, UI/UX Design at Ninjakiwi" ✅
- Bio: [actual bio content] ✅
```

## Testing & Verification

### Debug Functions Added

1. **`testSpeakerNames()`** - Comprehensive speaker data and rendering analysis
2. **Enhanced `runComprehensiveDiagnostic()`** - Includes speaker name population testing
3. **Console logging** - Detailed speaker data structure inspection

### Test Commands

Run in browser console:
```javascript
testSpeakerNames();           // Detailed speaker name analysis
runComprehensiveDiagnostic(); // Full system test including speakers
```

### Expected Test Results

- **No "Speaker TBA" or "Speaker Name" placeholder text** in rendered panels
- **Combined position + company** information properly displayed  
- **All speaker fields populated** from API data
- **Proper fallback handling** for missing speaker information
- **No JavaScript errors** related to undefined speaker properties

## Files Modified

1. **`js/data-transformer.js`**
   - Enhanced `_standardizeSpeaker()` method
   - Added `name` field for compatibility
   - Created combined `position` + `company` field
   - Preserved original API field structure

2. **`js/unified-event-loader.js`**
   - Added fallback logic for `name` vs `displayName`
   - Enhanced speaker data validation  
   - Improved safety checks for null/undefined speakers

3. **`js/expanded-event-details-manager.js`**
   - Added fallback logic for speaker name display
   - Enhanced safety checks for missing speaker data
   - Improved bio and position field handling

4. **`.widget-tests/widget-demo.html`**
   - Added `testSpeakerNames()` debug function
   - Enhanced comprehensive diagnostic with speaker testing
   - Added speaker name test button to UI

## Data Flow Summary

```
API Data → DataTransformer → Widget Events → Rendered Panels

1. API: "displayName": "Aimee Cairns"
2. Transformer: Creates both "name" and "displayName" fields  
3. Widget: Uses "name" field with "displayName" fallback
4. Rendered: "Aimee Cairns" appears in all speaker name locations
```

## Backward Compatibility

- **Original API fields preserved**: `displayName`, `position`, `company` remain unchanged
- **New compatibility fields added**: `name` field for widget compatibility  
- **Enhanced data available**: Combined position+company field for better display
- **Fallback logic**: Handles both old and new data structures gracefully

## Future Considerations

1. **Speaker Images**: Consider implementing speaker headshot display from `speakerImage` field
2. **Speaker Bios**: Enhance bio display in expanded details from `copy` field (with HTML stripping)
3. **Speaker Links**: Implement social media and website links from API data
4. **Multiple Speakers**: Test and optimize display for events with many speakers
5. **Speaker Roles**: Consider using `speakerRoles` data for more detailed speaker information
