## Issue Description

The unified Friday/Saturday schedule widget had incorrectly designed filter dropdown menus that didn't match the design and functionality of the original morning and afternoon widgets. The dropdown items were not styled properly and lacked dynamic category generation.

## Problems Identified

### 1. CSS Class Mismatch
- **Problem**: The unified widget hardcoded dropdown items using `<div class="category-option">` 
- **Expected**: Should use `<div class="category-dropdown-item">` to match existing CSS styles
- **Impact**: Dropdown items had no styling, appearing as plain text without proper colors, hover effects, or visual hierarchy

### 2. Event Handler Mismatch  
- **Problem**: JavaScript event handlers looked for `.category-option` selectors
- **Expected**: Should target `.category-dropdown-item` to match the correct CSS class
- **Impact**: Dropdown selection functionality was broken

### 3. Static vs Dynamic Generation
- **Problem**: Categories were hardcoded in HTML, showing all 12 categories regardless of actual event data
- **Expected**: Should dynamically generate dropdown options based on categories that actually exist in the morning/afternoon events data
- **Impact**: Users saw irrelevant filter options for categories with no events

### 4. Missing Methods
- **Problem**: The unified widget lacked the helper methods for dynamic dropdown generation
- **Expected**: Should implement `generateCategoryDropdownHTML()`, `generateCategoryOptions()`, `getAvailableCategories()`, and `generateAllCategoryOptions()` methods
- **Impact**: Could not dynamically adapt dropdown contents based on available event data

## Changes Made

### File: `JS Embed/html/nzgdc-widget/js/friday-saturday-widget-core.js`

#### 1. Replaced Hardcoded HTML with Dynamic Generation
**Lines 103-119 (Morning)** and **Lines 124-140 (Afternoon)**:
- Removed 14 lines of hardcoded `<div class="category-option">` elements per view
- Replaced with `${this.generateCategoryDropdownHTML(viewType)}` method call

#### 2. Added Dynamic Dropdown Generation Methods
**New Methods Added (Lines 143-232)**:

- **`generateCategoryDropdownHTML(viewType)`**: Creates backdrop and overlay container with dynamic options
- **`generateCategoryOptions(viewType)`**: Generates dropdown items based on available categories in event data
- **`getAvailableCategories(viewType)`**: Scans morning/afternoon event data to find which categories actually have events  
- **`generateAllCategoryOptions(allCategories)`**: Fallback method to show all categories if none found in data

#### 3. Fixed Event Handler Selectors
**Line 492**:
- Changed `dropdown.querySelectorAll(".category-option")` 
- To `dropdown.querySelectorAll(".category-dropdown-item")`

#### 4. Implemented Category Filtering Logic
- Categories are now filtered to only show those with actual events
- "All Events" option is always included and appears first
- Remaining categories are sorted alphabetically  
- Fallback shows all categories if none found in data

## Technical Details

### Category Data Sources
- **Morning View**: Uses `window.MORNING_EVENTS` data
- **Afternoon View**: Uses `window.AFTERNOON_EVENTS` data  
- **Fallback**: Shows all 11 standard categories if no events found

### CSS Class Structure
All dropdown items now use the correct class structure:
```html
<div class="category-dropdown-item" data-category="CATEGORY_KEY" tabindex="0">
  CATEGORY NAME
</div>
```

### Supported Categories
The system supports 11 event categories:
1. Game Design
2. Art  
3. Programming
4. Audio
5. Story & Narrative
6. Business & Marketing
7. Culture
8. Production & QA
9. Realities (VR, AR, MR)
10. Data, Testing or Research
11. Serious & Educational Games

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Visual Testing**: Verify dropdown items now have proper styling with category colors
2. **Functional Testing**: Confirm dropdown selection works and filters events correctly
3. **Data Testing**: Test with various event datasets to ensure dynamic generation works
4. **Responsive Testing**: Check dropdown behavior across different screen sizes
5. **Accessibility Testing**: Verify tabindex and keyboard navigation functionality

## Files Modified

- `JS Embed/html/nzgdc-widget/js/friday-saturday-widget-core.js`

## Dependencies

This fix relies on:
- Existing CSS styles in `category-filter-overlay.css`
- Event data structures in `MORNING_EVENTS` and `AFTERNOON_EVENTS`
- Consistent category key naming across event data

#### 5. Added Dynamic Filter Label Updates
**New Methods Added (Lines 234-318)**:
- **`updateFilterValueText(categoryName, viewType)`**: Updates filter button text and applies category background colors
- **`updateTriangleState(isOpen, viewType)`**: Rotates triangle between ▶ (closed) and ▼ (open) states
- **`getCategoryClassFromKey(categoryKey)`**: Maps category keys to CSS class names for styling

#### 6. Enhanced Dropdown Event Handling
**Modified `setupDropdownHandlers()` (Lines 566-616)**:
- Added triangle state management on dropdown open/close
- Implemented category key tracking for each view
- Enhanced category selection to update filter labels with proper colors
- Added proper state management for dropdown visibility

#### 7. Added Category State Tracking
**Constructor Updates (Lines 44-46)**:
- Added `this.morningCategoryKey = "ALL"` and `this.afternoonCategoryKey = "ALL"`
- Enables independent filter state tracking for morning and afternoon views

#### 8. Added Clear Filter Functionality
**New Methods Added (Lines 641-765)**:
- **`clearFilter(viewType)`**: Resets filter to "All Events" and applies to generators
- **`overrideGeneratorFiltering()`**: Overrides generator filtering methods to inject clear filter buttons
- **`showClearFilterButtons(viewType)`**: Creates clear filter buttons when filtering is applied
- **`hideClearFilterButtons(viewType)`**: Removes clear filter buttons when filtering is cleared

#### 9. Auto-Clear Filters When Switching Views
**Modified `switchToView()` (Lines 454)**:
- Added automatic filter clearing when switching between morning/afternoon views
- Ensures clean slate when users change views

#### 10. Dedicated Clear Filter Button Rows
**Generator Method Override (Lines 370, 667-760)**:
- Overrides `applyEventFiltering()` and `clearEventFiltering()` methods in both generators
- Creates dedicated clear filter button rows inserted after each event panel row
- Buttons appear exactly when events get grayed out during filtering
- Clean integration without overlaying on existing content
- Perfect timing synchronization with the actual filtering process

### Dynamic Features Implemented

#### Filter Label Updates
- **Default State**: Shows "ALL EVENTS ▶" with neutral styling
- **Category Selected**: Shows "CATEGORY NAME ▶" with category-specific background color
- **Color Coding**: Each category gets its distinctive background color from existing CSS

#### Triangle Rotation Animation
- **Closed State**: Shows right-pointing triangle (▶) 
- **Open State**: Shows down-pointing triangle (▼)
- **Smooth Transition**: Triangle rotates when clicking filter button or selecting category

#### Independent View States
- **Morning View**: Maintains its own category selection and filter state
- **Afternoon View**: Maintains separate category selection and filter state  
- **Auto-Clear on Switch**: Filter states automatically reset to "All Events" when switching views

#### Clear Filter Buttons
- **Clean Design**: White background with subtle shadow, no border, no rounded corners
- **Dedicated Rows**: Each button gets its own row inserted after event panel rows
- **Consistent Spacing**: Matches event panel row spacing with 40px bottom margin
- **Perfect Alignment**: Left-aligned buttons with no unnecessary padding or margins
- **Enhanced Visibility**: Larger button size (20px font, 12px/20px padding) for better prominence
- **No Overlay Issues**: Buttons don't overlay existing content - proper structural integration
- **Perfect Timing**: Appear exactly when event filtering is applied (events get grayed out)
- **Automatic Management**: Show when `applyEventFiltering()` runs, hide when `clearEventFiltering()` runs
- **Instant Reset**: One-click return to "All Events" view without scrolling to top
- **Design Consistency**: Sharp corners match the design language used throughout the widget

## Result
