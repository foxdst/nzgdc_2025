# NZGDC Event Panel Text Size Fixes

## Issue Summary
The text sizes in the Main Event Panel (300x300) components were inconsistent with the reference design specifications. The implemented sizes were significantly smaller than intended, affecting readability and visual hierarchy.

## Files Modified

### 1. `css/unified-event-panel.css`
**Main Event Panel (300x300) Text Size Updates:**
- **Category Text**: `14px` → `16px` (font-weight: `600` → `500`, line-height: `18px` → `22px`)
- **Title Text**: `16px` → `18px` (line-height: `22px` → `26px`)
- **Speaker Name**: `12px` → `18px` (added `font-style: italic`, line-height: `16px` → `23px`)
- **Speaker Position**: `11px` → `18px` (line-height: `14px` → `23px`)
- **CTA Text**: `12px` → `16px` (line-height: `16px` → `21px`)

**Responsive Updates (480px breakpoint):**
- Title, Speaker Name, Speaker Position: Maintained proportional scaling with `16px` minimum

### 2. `css/morning-schedule-bundle.css`
**Morning Widget Main Panel Overrides Fixed:**
- Updated all Main Event Panel text elements to match reference design
- Fixed responsive breakpoint font sizes to maintain consistency
- Added missing `font-style: italic` for speaker names
- Enhanced `overflow-wrap: break-word` for better text handling

### 3. `css/afternoon-schedule-bundle.css`
**Afternoon Widget Main Panel Overrides Fixed:**
- Applied identical updates to afternoon widget styles
- Ensured consistency with morning widget and unified CSS
- Updated responsive font sizes to prevent overly small text on mobile

## Reference Design Compliance

### Before Fix (Inconsistent Sizes)
- Category: 14px, Title: 16px, Speaker Name: 12px, Speaker Position: 11px, CTA: 12px

### After Fix (Reference Compliant)
- Category: 16px, Title: 18px, Speaker Name: 18px (italic), Speaker Position: 18px, CTA: 16px

### Big Event Panel (620x300)
- **No changes required** - already matched reference design specifications
- Category: 16px, Title: 18px, Speaker Name: 14px, Speaker Position: 14px, Timeframe: 16px

## Key Improvements

1. **Visual Hierarchy**: Proper text sizing now creates clear information hierarchy
2. **Readability**: Increased font sizes improve legibility, especially on mobile devices
3. **Consistency**: All widget types (Thursday, Morning, Afternoon) now use consistent sizing
4. **Responsive Design**: Maintained proportional scaling across all breakpoints
5. **Reference Alignment**: Text sizes now match the original design specifications

## Testing Recommendations

1. Load the widget demo page (`widget-demo.html`)
2. Test all three widget types (Thursday, Morning, Afternoon)
3. Verify text sizes on desktop and mobile breakpoints
4. Confirm that text remains readable and properly sized
5. Use the built-in `testMainEventPanelCSS()` function for CSS verification

## Technical Notes

- CSS specificity conflicts were resolved by updating widget-specific overrides
- Font-weight adjustments ensure consistency with design system
- Line-height values optimized for better vertical rhythm
- Overflow handling improved with `overflow-wrap: break-word`
- Responsive scaling maintains readability at all screen sizes
