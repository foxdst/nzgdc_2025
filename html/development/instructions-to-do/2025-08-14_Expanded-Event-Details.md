I need you to write detailed instructions to develop an Expanded Event Details overlay for the currently existing Event Panel designs in the JS Widget.

These expanded event details appears as an overlay window that reveals additional event details of the respective Event Panel - which the user sees after clicking on the respective Event Panel's overlay area.

For starters, to ensure a proper integration of this Expanded Event Details window design, we'll be creating an HTML file prototype that contains all of the HTML, CSS, and any necessary JS code for it to work completely on its own.

The Expanded Event Details window is organised and laid out as such:

(TOP) - Event Header
(MIDDLE) - Event Description
(BOTTOM) - Speaker Bios

The **Event Header** is designed to have an Event Title with the respective event's speaker names underneath said Event Title.
The **Event Description** contains, obviously, the synopsis/summary of the event, with a horizontal line separating underneath where the Audience Group tags can be found (which labels which appropriate audiences are suitable in attending this event).
The **Speaker Bios** are stylised as like a business card; with a headshot image on the left-hand side, a "Speaker Bio" header on the top right-hand side, and below the header is the actual speaker bio details themselves which includes their name, position/title, pronouns, professional intro/summary, and contact details (email, website).

Attached to these instructions is an image of the already designed Expanded Event Details that you need to develop. Notice how the layout and design replicates some of the already existing design elements found all throughout the JS Widget. In order for this Expanded Event Details to be developed you need to reuse as much of the CSS properties found all throughout the JS Widget as possible (renamed of course to the new Expanded Event Details window) ensure that the properties aren't some made up new design specification that is completely separate to the Event Panel designs, or schedule view designs that already exist in the JS Widget.

With all that in mind, and referring to the attached image of the Expanded Event Details' finalised design, create detailed, comprehensive instructions in the 'tasks-drafts' folder, that can be easily read by another AI Assistant, to perfectly develop this Expanded Event Details in a prototype HTML file.

Make sure you read through the important warnings and documentation found in the 'tasks' folder first before you commence writing these instructions as there is a high risk of AI hallucination and bad coding practices that can jeoprodise the development of the Expanded Event Details design.
